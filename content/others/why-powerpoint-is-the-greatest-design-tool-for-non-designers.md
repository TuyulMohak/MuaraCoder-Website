## What Is Powerpoint
PowerPoint is software for making presentation slides. I believe nearly everyone knows it. PowerPoint is made by Microsoft, so the likelihood is you already had it on your computer when you bought it (if you use Windows).

## Why I use Powerpoint
Okay, I'm a web developer with little design skill. I'm making lots of simple designs to display my work lately. I was using Canva and Figma, but it's just too heavy for my laptop. I feel like putting too much pressure on it. So, then I think again: what is the most lightweight thing that I can use quickly and easily? I tried using Paint, but it's just horrible. Then I used PowerPoint, and it worked pretty well. In this post, I will share the advantages and disadvantages that I found when using it.

## Advantages

### Lightweight
First of all, for low-end devices, design apps like Illustrator or Corel Draw are no go; the device will be overheated in minutes. My laptop is a powerful Intel Celeron and is able to run Assassin's Creed 3 at an average of 7 frames per second with a 600 x 800 resolution. Even with that immense power, my laptop starts lagging when I put more than 10 squares on the screen. PowerPoint, on the other hand, is lightweight and fast.

### Great for Beginner
Beginners need to watch an hour-long tutorial video explaining the basics of the tools you'll never use in Adobe Illustrator (if you're not a designer). It's a different case with PowerPoint; I believe everyone learned it in high school or junior high school already.

### Great for Simple Design
Most of the time, for a non-designer, designing is a matter of placing text, images, lines, and color on the screen. With PowerPoint, you can do all that. I don't think it will be a huge difference if a non-designer creates a poster in PowerPoint and Illustrator.

## Disadvantages

### Limited Design Feature
So, PowerPoint is not perfect after all; there are absolutely limitations. such as you can't make gradient-colored text, you can't draw anime, and you can't create UI/UX for a website. It's just not recommended for that type of design work.

### Still Need Basic Design Skill
It won't work as magically as Canva; it doesn't have the same wide array of beautiful templates where you can just change the text and images. You need to know a little about composition, layout, and color theory to make it work.

## Summary
PowerPoint is an awesome tool that everyone can use. It has several advantages and disadvantages. For someone like me who needs to make simple designs but has a slow laptop. Use it; just open Microsoft PowerPoint, write a text, change the font and the background color, and you're done. One more thing: This post may sound satirical, but I'm serious for the most part. Thank you for your attention.
