In this post I will share my experience of using few for the last year. I will outline the advantages and disadvantages of using it. Let's get started. 

## What is Vue?

>Vue is a JavaScript framework for creating user interfaces, and it is pronounced similarly to view (/vju/). It provides a declarative and component-based programming model that enables you to effectively create user interfaces, whether they are straightforward or intricate. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. [(Vue Js Documentation, 2023)](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#what-is-vue)


## Why I love Vue

Okay so, Vue is the first javascript framework that I learned, It doesn't necessarily require extensive Javascript knowledge, Easy Syntax for beginner to understand, and Lightweight. I've been learning it since 2021 while still learning basics of Javascript, made various things using vue, you can check it on my [Portfolio website](https://muhammad-rivandra.netlify.app/#/). I even made this website using vue with Nuxt 3. The state management using [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org) is awesome and extremely easy to use and routing with [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org) is great. I really recommend it. 

This is the awesome things, I recently tried to learn React, It's shocked me that I can understand the basics in couple of days, I believe It took me 1 to 3 weeks to understand state management with Zustand and Routing with React Router If I start today. I believe It all because of Vue, when you understand Vue, you can just jump to other framework without too much difficulties. That's why I love Vue Js.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

Even though the awesome things that I mentioned before, It's absolutely have advantages and disadvantages. I'll Outline it in this section.


### Advantages

* Lightweight
* Beginner Friendly
* Easy to Understand Documentation
* Pretty Syntax
* Ease to Jump to Other Frameworks


### Disadvantages 

* Little Tutorial Available 
* Smaller community


## Summary

Okay, so that's it. That's Vue js. an awesome Front end Javascript framework. If you are a beginner with limited Javascript skill, I recommend you to use it. Also if you're an expert, try it. But I believe, It's good to know more than framework, either backend framework like Express or other frontend like React.
