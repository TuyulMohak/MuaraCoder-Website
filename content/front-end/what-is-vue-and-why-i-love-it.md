In this post I will share my experience of using VueJs since the 2022. Let's get started. 

## What is Vue?

>Vue is a JavaScript framework for creating user interfaces, and it is pronounced similarly to view (/vju/). It provides a declarative and component-based programming model that enables you to effectively create user interfaces, whether they are straightforward or intricate. It builds on top of standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. [(Vue Js Documentation, 2023)](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html#what-is-vue)


## Why I love Vue

Okay, so Vue is the first Javascript framework that I learned. It doesn't necessarily require extensive Javascript knowledge, has easy syntax for beginners to understand, and is also lightweight. I've been learning it since 2022 while still learning the basics of Javascript. I've made various things using Vue; you can check them out on my [Portfolio website](https://muhammad-rivandra.netlify.app/#/). I even made this website using Vue with Nuxt 3. The state management using [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org) is awesome and extremely easy to use, and routing with [Vue Router](https://router.vuejs.org) is great. I really recommend it. 


This is the awesome thing: I recently tried to learn React. It shocks me that I can understand the basics in a couple of days. I believe it will take me 1â€“3 weeks to understand state management with Zustand and routing with React Router if I start today. When you understand Vue, you can just jump to other frameworks without too much difficulty. That's why I love Vue Js.

## Advantages and Disadvantages

In this section, I'll outline the advantages and disadvantages of VueJS that I found.


### Advantages

* Lightweight
* Beginner Friendly
* Easy to Understand Documentation
* Pretty Syntax
* Ease to Jump to Other Frameworks


### Disadvantages 

* Little Tutorial Available 
* Smaller community
* Fewer job posting (than something like React)


## Summary

Okay, so that's it. That's VueJS, an awesome front-end Javascript framework. If you are a beginner with limited Javascript skills, I recommend you use it. Also, if you're an expert, try it. It's really easy to get started with. But I believe it's good to know more than frameworks, either backend frameworks like Express or frontend frameworks like React. Good luck with your web development journey, and check out the other Simple Vue 3 guide on MuaraCoder.
