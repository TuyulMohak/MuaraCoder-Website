## Introduction

### What Is Quasar JS
According to [Quasar Documentation](https://quasar.dev/introduction-to-quasar), Quasar is a Vue.js-based framework that is open-source and licensed by MIT. It enables web developers to rapidly create responsive websites and applications in multiple formats, such as SPAs, SSR, PWAs, BEX, mobile apps (Android, iOS, etc.) using Cordova or Capacitor, and multi-platform desktop apps using Electron. Quasar's primary goal is to allow developers to write code once and deploy it simultaneously as a website, mobile app, and/or Electron app, all from a single codebase. This is made possible by using a state-of-the-art CLI and Quasar web components that adhere to best practices, resulting in rapid app development times and high performance.

### Components
Quasar have +70 ready to use Material Design web components such as buttons, calendar, WYSIWYG Editor, and many more.

### Styling
Quasar offers a wide variety of CSS classes to make it simple for you to use Flexbox to build your UI. Imagine using rows and columns to operate while having a wide range of options available. Remember this, because you will use so many `row` and `col` classes. It's quite familiar if you know bootstrap.

## My Experience of Using Quasar JS
I started using Quasar JS in my early web development learning, after I knew the basics of Vue JS. It has every component I need, from drawer to button group. It's an awesome frame with everything you need available. I don't need to pick a CSS framework or find a component library, icons, etc. This is because Quasar already has it. The documentation is already so comprehensive and clean that you can easily understand it.

I also have some problems during use as a beginner developer, especially understanding the configuration and finding where to plug the cable. It's different from the usual vue. I remember once being confused about how to use `.env` file on Quasar because the usual way was not working. I have no idea where to use the `.env` file on the app. It turns out I need to modify the Quasar config file. The community is quite small, so when you find a problem in your app, it's harder to find the solution.

Overall, It's a solid framework. if you're interested, you must try it.

## Advantages and Disadvantages
In this section will outline the advantages and disadvantages of Quasar JS

### Pros
* Lots of components
* Beautiful components
* Easy styling
* clean and Comprehensive documentation
* Good for medium to big and complex application
* multiple formats: SPAs, SSR, PWAs, BEX, mobile apps (Android, iOS, etc.) using Cordova or Capacitor, and multi-platform desktop apps using Electron

### Cons
* Small community
* Little available tutorial
* Not recommended for small app (It's possible, but it's an overkill)
* Confusing configuration (for beginner)

## Summary
I've been using it for a year, from when I had no idea about front-end development until quite decent. It's suitable for a medium to big project that needs so many components and needs to be performant. Or you can be like me; I just make a simple sketch on a sheet of paper and then let Quasar determine how it looks. It's great for graphically challenged developers. Overall, it's been a great experience using it. I recommend you try it. Thank you for your attention.
